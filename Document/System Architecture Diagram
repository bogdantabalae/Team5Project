Angular Frontend - 
This is the UI part of the website. When a customer makes a purchase, angular sends a HTTP Request with JSON to the controlelr.

Spring Boot Controller - 
Controllers are API endpoints. It receives the HTTP request and converts the JSON into a Java object which allows the service layer
to process it.

Service Layer - 
This is the business logic of the project. It handles data vverification, e.g. check if user exists, check if product is available,
etc. 

Repositroy Layer - 
JPA/Hibernate converts Java objects into SQL and runs queries. This allows the database to communicate with the backend.

MySQL Database - 
The database stores all the data in tables, like customer information and product information.



The process is reversed when sending data from database to angular, which is then correctly displayed.
Angular never talks with the database directly.
